// DANTE MODULE ======
// Name: Magician
// Description: Few random commands, store, login, and dmods being the main commands. *Added encoding to the passwords.. Because I can (:*
// Author: Wizard-Kgalm 
// Version: 4.0
// Notes: Cleaned up the logins list, dmods, and invisistore by getting rid of the numbered storage for cleaner smaller files! :D
// ====================
//Activated on startup 
$modules[$m] = new Module($m,1); 
//Deactivated on startop
//$modules[$m] = new Module($m,0); //Uncomment to use this option and then comment out the one about.
$modules[$m]->setInfo(__FILE__); //NO TOUCHY or file will not load properly

// COMMANDS BELOW HERE. 								  // No longer branched! We've actually gotten better at this. No helps made for $me or $npmsg.
$modules[$m]->addCmd( 'logins'     , 'store'   , 99, 1 ); // $store is the pretext to $logins. Let's note that it's still overly verbose.( 2009 )
$modules[$m]->addCmd( 'invisistore', 'store'   , 99, 1 ); // AND WE CLONED IT TO MAKE A HIDDEN LIST. ( 2009 - 2013 )
$modules[$m]->addCmd( 'atswap'     , 'commands', 99, 1 ); // Good ol' $atswap. A classic still in its original form. ( 2009 - )
$modules[$m]->addCmd( 'show'       , 'commands', 99, 1 ); // $show was probably removed in the next version. ( 2009 - 2011 )
$modules[$m]->addCmd( 'token'      , 'token'   , 99, 1 ); // A staple, $token. Still in use today, FAR less grody in appearance now. ( 2009 - )
//$modules[$m]->addCmd( 'cookie'   , 'token'   , 99, 1 ); // $cookie had a short-lived usefulness for account jacking. The command has been retired, however. ( 2009 - 2011 )
$modules[$m]->addCmd( 'login'      , 'commands', 99, 1 ); // $login, another staple. Albeit primitive in this version. ( 2009 - )
$modules[$m]->addCmd( 'kickroll'   , 'commands', 75, 1 ); // I still have no idea why I haven't gotten rid of this. Nostalgia, methinks. ( 2009 - )
$modules[$m]->addCmd( 'addons'     , 'commands', 0 , 1 ); // $addons, more current, may still find itself useful at some point.. ( 2009 - )
$modules[$m]->addCmd( 'dmods'      , 'dmods'   , 0 , 1 ); // $dmods is the last staple. Remaining a useful module link system, with many projects in mind. ( 2009 - )
$modules[$m]->addCmd( 'shank'      , 'commands', 0 , 1 ); // $shank, as a command is what helped me learn to make things for Contra as well. Not a useful command though. ( 2009 - )
$modules[$m]->addCmd( 'me'         , 'commands', 0 , 1 ); // $me was added for input.. It remains here today. ( 2011 - )
$modules[$m]->addCmd( 'npmsg'      , 'commands', 0 , 1 ); // $npmsg was also added for input. Easier than $say /npmsg.. ( 2011 - )
														  // Released 7/16/2011. Another step up from the previous version, adding login verification and password encoding.
// HELPS BELOW HERE.
